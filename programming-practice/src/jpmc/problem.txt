/**
Requirements:-

1) Count errors within a given time period, if the number of errors in the period
exceeds or reaches a configurable level then the circuit breaker should open.
2) When the circuit breaker is open, this means that all executions should fail fast.
3) After a configurable period of time, the circuit breaker should close.
This means that executions will no longer fail fast.
